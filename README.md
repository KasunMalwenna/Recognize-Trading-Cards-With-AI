# Recognize-Trading-Cards-With-AI

This project is a collaborative effort among students from Data Science, UX Design, and Web Development, working to develop digital solutions for one of BrainStation’s industry partners, ALT (a leading sports trading card marketplace).

__Problem space__: How can we help ALT’s users navigate the world of trading goods and make more informed trading and investment decisions?

__Proposed Solution__:I developed a deep learning-based image classifier to accurately identify the sport depicted on sport trading cards and facilitate assigning users to appropriate chatrooms based on the cards in the user’s vault.The proposed charrooms will serve as a social platform where enthusiasts can connect, showcase their collections, and expand their knowledge of trading cards, ultimately increasing engagement with ALT.
