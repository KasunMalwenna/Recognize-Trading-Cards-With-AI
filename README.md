# Recognize-Trading-Cards-With-AI

This project is a collaborative effort among students from Data Science, UX Design, and Web Development, working to develop digital solutions for one of BrainStation’s industry partners, ALT (a leading sports trading card marketplace).

## About ALT?
ALT is a sports trading card marketplace that allows users to buy, sell, and trade cards from various sports like football, basketball, baseball and hockey. It also offers a community for enthusiasts to connect and access historical card pricing and trends. The platform aims to provide a safe, secure and transparent environment for sports trading card collectors worldwide.

I developed a deep learning-based image classifier to accurately identify the sport depicted on sport trading cards and facilitate assigning users to appropriate chatrooms based on the cards in the user’s vault.
